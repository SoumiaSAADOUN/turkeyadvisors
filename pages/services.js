              Projects tour:
            </h1>
            <p>
              After all the details become apparent to the buyer, from the point
              of purchase and the purpose of the buying, we can start our tour
              in a particular city. We will visit the sales offices of projects
              that correspond to the customer's choices and preferences; we will
              tour the project and take all the essential details and
              information.

            <br />
            <p>
              In addition to conducting a separate presentation for each project
              about: The real estate land data, the process of developing the
              purchasing value per meter in the project area, in addition to the
              future of the municipality, and the benefits that the buyer will
              obtain by purchasing with a specific project.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The last step will depend on the buyer's acceptance and
              satisfaction. If his requirements are compatible with a specific
              project, we will work on concluding an initial deal to take an
              offer of the purchasing value in the project.

              The fifth step depends on signing the sale-purchase contract;
              based on the purchase decision; we will have to take several legal
              actions, which are:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Extracting a tax number from the Turkish Taxes administration</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Opening a Turkish bank account obtaining a tourist residence
              permit for a foreign buyer
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Signing the contract, registering the required papers, and
              conducting the contract registration process at the Turkish notary
              for all the documents mentioned.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And if the buyer likes, it is possible to notarize the
              sale-purchase contract at the embassy of his country in Turkey
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But after we translate it into English and notarize the contract
              again.

            <br />
            <p>
              At this stage, we will have to carry out a tax exemption procedure
              for the foreign investor when the buyer is transferring the cash
              value of the property according to the sale-purchase contract to
              Turkey.
